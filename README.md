## About me

I am a self-learner with a strong career focus, excellent analytical skills, and keen attention to detail. I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and began my career as an Image Processing Developer (2019-2020), where I worked in an agile environment. Subsequently, I was employed as a teacher in the Biomedical Engineering Department at my college in Cairo (2020-2021), where I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills.
I am now seeking an opportunity as a Software Tester, where I can leverage my technical background and attention to detail. I’m currently studying for the ISTQB Foundation Level Certificate and am eager to contribute indirectly to ensure high-quality software delivery.
I would be extremely happy to apply the knowledge I have gained to test an operational product and gain hands-on experience. This would be a crucial step in my current career goal of becoming a mid-level software tester in two years.
