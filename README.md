## About me

I am a self-learner with a strong career focus, excellent analytical skills, and keen attention to detail. I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and began my career as an Image Processing Developer (2019-2020), where I worked in an agile environment. Subsequently, I was employed as a teacher in the Biomedical Engineering Department at my college in Cairo (2020-2021), where I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills. I am now seeking an opportunity as a Software Tester, where I can leverage my technical background and attention to detail. I’m currently studying for the ISTQB Foundation Level Certificate, and I am eager to indirectly contribute to ensuring high-quality software delivery.
• Visa Status: I have the right to work in The UK by tier 2 dependent Visa.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to test an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
